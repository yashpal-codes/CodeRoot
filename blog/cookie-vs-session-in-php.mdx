# Cookies vs. Sessions - The PHP Guide

A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser stores it on the user's device and sends it back with the request when the user visits the same website again.

Cookies are used to store user information, active session, user preferences etc.

When you visit a particular website, some information is saved on your local system so that when you visit the same website again, the website is able to recognize you and show you the results according to your preferences. This saved information is called a cookie.

  src={cookieWorking}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

### Why use Cookies?

- Let’s consider a scenario where you visit a website and the website’s default language is not English and the website’s default mode is dark mode.

- Now you change the language to English and change the mode to light mode.

- If you close the browser and visit the website again, the website will display content in the default language and in dark mode.

- If we visit same website 10 times in day, we have to change the language and mode 10 times.

- To overcome this and uniquely remember the user, the server sends cookies along with the response, and the browser stores the cookies.

- **When the user visits the website again, the browser sends the cookies along with the request, and the server can identify the user and display the content in the language and mode the user has selected.**

### Difference between Cookies and Cache

/>

### Cookies are safe to use

- Cookies are safe to use, as they are stored on the user’s local system and can only be accessed by the server that set the cookies.

- A cookie cannot be used by any other server as the id saved in the cookie is unique to the server that set cookie.

- In a cookie, only non-sensitive user information should be stored, not passwords or other sensitive data, unless encrypted and secured.

- Cookies cannot contain viruses or malware.

### Types of Cookies

<img
  alt="cookies"
  src={typeOfCookies}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

#### First Party Cookies

- This cookie is set by the website you are visiting.

<img
  alt="cookies"
  src={FPTPCookies}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

- As illustrated above, if you visit website a.com and you attempt to access a service from the same domain name a.com, cookies generated will be considered first-party cookies.

- Example: login information, user preferences, etc.

#### Third Party Cookies

- This cookie is set by a domain other than the one you are visiting.

- Whereas, if you visit a website a.com but that page includes content (image, iframe, etc.) from a different domain name b.com, cookies set by b.com will be considered third-party cookies because they come from a different name than in the URL bar: a.com.

- Example: ads, analytics, other sites you visit, like a news site, a hotel site, or a blog you read..

- **Third-party cookies are often used for online advertising and retargeting and user tracking, meaning they can track your browsing habits and serve you ads based on your interests.**

<img alt="cookies" src={FPTP2} style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }} />

  src={accessibility}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

### Use of Cookies

#### Session management

- Secure interaction between web browser and server.
- login, auto-fill, shopping cart, etc.

#### Personalization

- User preferences, themes, etc.

##### Tracking

- User behavior, analytics, etc.
- Ad tracking, retargeting, etc.

### Cookie Attributes

1. **Name**: The name of the cookie.
2. **Value**: The value of the cookie.
3. **Domain and Path**:

- **Domain**:

  - Domain attribute specifies the domain who can access the cookie.
  - If the domain attribute is not set, the cookie can only be accessed by the domain that set the cookie.
  - Example: Domain="google.com"

- **Path**:
  - Path attribute specifies the URL path for which the cookie is valid.
  - If the path attribute is not set, the cookie is valid for the entire domain.
  - If Path '/'' is set, the cookie is valid for the entire domain.
  - Example: Path="/docs"

4. **Expires and Max-Age**:

- **Expires**:
  _ The expires attribute specifies the date and time when the cookie will expire.
  _ If the expires attribute is not set, the cookie will expire when the browser is closed. \* Example: Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2021 07:28:00 GMT

  5.**SameSite**:

- The SameSite attribute specifies whether the cookie is sent with cross-site requests.
- When clicking a link within a webpage, your cookies can be sent to the new page you are visiting. We can control this behavior using the SameSite attribute.

- SameSite attributes have 3 options:
  - **SameSite=Strict** : The cookie is only sent if the request originates from the same site, this ensures that the cookie is not sent with requests from third-party websites. This ensure high security.
  - **SameSite=Lax** : The cookie is sent with same-site requests and safe cross-site requests, which include top-level navigation (e.g., clicking a link to your site from another site). This is the default value for cookies in most modern browsers.
    - Example Usage: It's a balanced approach that allows simple cross-site linking but restricts the cookie from being sent with requests initiated by third-party sites, like form submissions from another site.
  - **SameSite=None** : The cookie is sent with both same-site and cross-site requests. This is used for third-party cookies.
    - This must be used in conjunction with the Secure attribute, meaning the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS connections.
    - Example Usage: This is used for third-party cookies, like those used for ads or other tracking services

6. **Secure**:

- The Secure attribute specifies that the cookie should only be sent over a secure HTTPS connection from the client. This is used to ensure that the cookie is always sent over an encrypted connection.

7. **HttpOnly**:

- The HttpOnly attribute specifies that the cookie is not accessible via JavaScript. This is used to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

<TextHighlighter text=" When using SameSite-'None', it is recommended to enable Secure and HttpOnly attributes for security reasons." />

### Cookie Example

In this example, the server includes several cookies for the client to store. In subsequent HTTP requests, the client sends all of the cookies back to the server using the Cookie request header field. The two exceptions are screen mode, which will not be sent after January 1st, 2023, and job, which will only be sent for the next hour.

**Response**

```HTTP
// Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length:
Set-Cookie: items=16
Set-Cookie: headerColor=blue
Set-Cookie: footerColor=green
Set-Cookie: screenMode=dark, Expires=Sun, 1 Jan 2023 12:00:00 GMT
Set-Cookie: job=111; Max-Age: 3600; Secure; HttpOnly

```

**Request ( after few mins)**

```HTTP
// Request

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.re
Cookie: items=16; headerColor=blue; screenMode=dark; job=111

```

**Request (more than an hour later but before January 1st, 2023)**

```HTTP
// Request, job is not sent as it is expired

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.re
Cookie: items=16; headerColor=blue; screenMode=dark

```

## Setting a cookie in PHP

- To set a cookie in PHP, we use the setCookie() function.

- setCookie() return true if the cookie is set successfully, otherwise it returns false.

```php
<?php
// Set the cookie
setCookie(
    name: 'user',
    value: 1,
    expires: time() + 3600,
    domain: 'example.com',
    path:'/',
    secure: true,
    HttpOnly: true,
    SameSite:'Lax',
)
```

### $\_COOKIE

- The $\_COOKIE super global variable is used to access the cookie values that are sent by the client.

```php

if (isset($_COOKIE['cookie_name'])) {
	// process the cookie value
}
```

### Deleting a cookie

- To delete a cookie, we set the cookie with an expiration date in the past.

```php
<?php
// Set the cookie time in the past
setCookie(
    name: 'cookie_name',
    value: null
    expires: time() - 3600,
    domain: 'example.com',
)
```

## Sessions in PHP

Sessions are used to store user information on the **server** for later use. Unlike cookies, the information is not stored on the client's computer.

Imagine you're visiting a website where you need to log in to see your personal dashboard. Here's how it works with and without sessions:

**Without Sessions**

1. Logging In: You enter your username and password to log in.
2. Problem: Each time you visit a new page on the site (like your dashboard), the website doesn't remember who you are. This is because each page request is independent, and the server doesn't have any memory due to the nature of HTTP, which doesn't keep track of interactions between requests.

**With Sessions**

1. Logging In: You enter your username and password and submit the form.
2. Session Creation: The server creates a session for you and stores some information about you, like your user ID. It then sends back a session ID, usually stored in a cookie in your browser.
3. Accessing the Dashboard:
   - When you click on your dashboard, your browser automatically sends the session ID back to the server.
   - The server recognizes you because it has stored your information in the session associated with that session ID.
   - You can access your dashboard because the server knows you're logged in.

<br />

<img alt="cookies" src={Session} style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }} />

- **PHPSESSID** is the default name given by the PHP back-end server that created the session ID.

### Working of Sessions

- When you log in, a session is created with a unique ID (session ID). The session ID will be **sent** to the user’s browser.

- The server will then create a session variable auth_user ( for example ) and store in it the information of the actual logged in user. The session data will be stored in a file on the server side. The name of the file will be the session ID.

- When the user request the dashboard page, the browser will send the cookie that contain the session ID with the request.

- The server receives an incoming request, retrieves the session ID, and searches for the associated session. Once the session is found, the server retrieves the data.

- Finally, the server will need to check the existence of the auth_user session variable. If it finds it, the server will grant access to the dashboard page.

<TextHighlighter text="Sessions are often used to store sensitive information such as user credentials and financial data. They are more secure than cookies because the information is stored on the **server-side and not on the client-side." />

### Starting a Session

- To start a session in PHP, we use the **session_start()** function.
- When session_start() runs the first time, it creates a session ID and sends it to the browser by storing it in a cookie named PHPSESSID.
- If a session already exists, PHP checks the PHPSESSID cookie sent by the browser and session_start() will resume the existing session by using the session ID stored in the cookie.
- **Since PHP sends the PHPSESSID cookie in the header of the HTTP response, you need to call the session_start() function before any statement that outputs the content to the web browser.**
- Otherwise, you will get a warning message saying that the header cannot be modified because it is already sent. This is a well-know error message in PHP.

```php
// Start the session
session_start();
```

- By default, PHP stores session data in temporary files on the web server. You can find the location of the temporary files using directive session.save_path in the PHP configuration file.

- The ini_get() function returns the value of the session.save_path directive:

```php
// Get the session save path
$sessionSavePath = ini_get('session.save_path');
echo $sessionSavePath;
```

### Storing Session Data

- To store session data, we use the **$\_SESSION** super global variable.

```php
//profile.php
// Store data in the session
session_start();

$_SESSION['user_id'] = 1;
$_SESSION['user'] = 'admin';
#_SESSION['role'] = ['admin', 'editor','administrator'];
```

- Now we can create a index.php file and access the session data.

```php
//index.php
session_start();

echo $_SESSION['user_id']; // Output: 1
echo $_SESSION['user']; // Output: admin
```

### Deleting a Session

- When you close the web browser, the session cookie (e.g., PHPSESSID) typically expires, but the session data remains on the server until it is deleted or garbage-collected by PHP.

- It deletes the associated data but does not unset the data in the $\_SESSION array or the session ID stored in the cookie.

- To completely remove session data, we need to delete the session ID stored in the cookie.

```php
session_start();

// Deleting cookie
if(isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])){
    setCookie(session_name(),null,time()-3600,'/');
}

// Unset data in $_SESSION array
$_SESSION = [];

// Destroy the session
session_destroy();

```

## Difference between Cookies and Sessions

| Cookies                                                                         | Sessions                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cookies are stored on the client-side.                                          | Sessions are stored on the server-side.                                                         |
| Cookies are less secure as they can be tampered with.                           | Sessions are more secure as they are stored on the server-side.                                 |
| Cookies can store a limited amount of data up to 4KB.                           | Sessions can store a large amount of data.                                                      |
| Cookies can be disabled by the user.                                            | Sessions cannot be disabled by the user.                                                        |
| Cookies are used to store user information, preferences, etc.                   | Sessions are used to store sensitive information such as user credentials, financial data, etc. |
| Cookies are used to track user behavior, analytics, etc.                        | Sessions are used to manage user sessions, login, shopping cart, etc.                           |
| Cookies store data in text format.                                              | Sessions store data in encrypted serialized format.                                             |
| In PHP **$\_COOKIE **super global variable is used to access the cookie values. | In PHP **$\_SESSION** superglobal variable is used to access the session values.                |

## Summary

- **setCookie()** function is used to set a cookie in PHP.
- **$\_COOKIE **super global variable is used to access the cookie values.
- To delete a cookie, we **set** the cookie with an **expiration** **date** in the **past**.

- **session_start()** function is used to start a session in PHP.
- **$\_SESSION** super global variable is used to access and store session data.
