# Introduction

Welcome to **Learning Programming** - a comprehensive guide to web development and programming fundamentals.

## What is This?

This documentation site contains everything I've learned about programming, starting from the basics:

- **HTML** - Semantic markup and document structure
- **CSS** - Styling, layouts, and Flexbox
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **React** - Building interactive user interfaces
- **PHP** - Server-side web development
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for backends (coming soon)

## Getting Started

This site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a modern documentation framework. To explore the content:

1. Use the sidebar navigation to browse different topics
2. Each section contains detailed explanations and examples
3. Feel free to check out the blog for additional tutorials and insights

## How to Run Locally

If you want to run this documentation site on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) package manager

### Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CodeRoot
yarn install
```

### Development Server

```bash
yarn start
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/` and will automatically reload when you make changes.

### Build for Production
