# Block and Inline level element.

### Block level

- Block level elements take full width of their parent container.
- Block level elements always starts with new line.
- Can have width, height, margin, padding and border properties,
- Block level can have inline element inside them.
- `<div>` , `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<section>`, `<header>` etc are block level

### Inline

- Inline element takes width as required,
- Do not start with new line, they will appear in same line.
- ** Cannot have width or height applied**.
- ** Cannot contain block level element**.
- `span`, `a`, `strong`, `i`, `u`, `<img>` are inline element.

```html live
<>
    <div style={{color:"blue"}}>This is a block element</div>
    <div style={{color:"orange"}}>This is a another block level element</div>
    <br/>


    // Both span element will appear in same line, as they do not start with new line.
    <br />
    <span style={{color:"blue"}}> I'm span </span>
    <span style={{color:"orange"}}> Another span element </span>

    <br />
    <br />

    <p> My Name is <strong> Ram </strong> . </p>
    <p> My Name is <span style={{color:"green"}}> Ram </span> . </p>
</>
```

- If you noticed in between last two `<p>` tags there is a space, that space is due to p tag, which is a block level element and start with new line.
