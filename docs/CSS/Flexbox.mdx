### Flexbox is CSS display property

- Flexbox is directional base layout, which has two axis/direction

  - Main axis
  - Cross axis

- In CSS we define them by flex direction,
  - If flex-direction is row, than Main axis will be horizontal and cross axis will be vertical
  - If flex-direction is column, than Main axis will be vertical and cross axis will be horizontal.

<img
  alt="flexbox"
  src={require("./assets/flexbox.png").default}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

<br />

- Flex is container based, there is parent container and flex-items are child.
- Both FlexBox Container and Flex Items have properties.

### Flexbox Container Properties

#### 1. **`display:flex`**

#### 2. **`flex-direction`** : Define flex Main and Cross Axis

    - row
    - column
    - row-reverse
    - column-reverse

#### 3. **`flex-wrap`** : Define if flex items will wrap or not

    - wrap : when no enough space available, last items will be moved to next row/line.
    - Consider this you are writing in a line into text book, while writing you reach at the end of line, you will start writing to next line below current one.
    - Similar way in wrap, when wrap is enabled, and there is no enough space, last few items will move to next row.
    - no-wrap : items does not float. This is default.
    - wrap-reverse : reverse the wrap.

<img
  alt="flexbox"
  src={require("./assets/flex-wrap.png").default}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

#### 4. **`flex-flow`** : Shorthand property for flex direction and wrap

    - column wrap
    - row no-wrapper

#### 5. **`justify-content`** : Most of properties start with 'justify' are aligned with Main axis

    - This property moved flex items on Main axis, if Main axis is horizontal, items will be moved horizontally,
    - If Main axis is vertical, items will be moved vertically.
    - flex-start
    - center
    - flex-end
    - space-between

<img
  alt="flexbox"
  src={require("./assets/flex-justify.png").default}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

<br />

#### 6. **`align-items`** : Properties start with 'align' are aligned with Cross Axis

    - This property moved flex items on Cross axis, eg: for flex row, cross axis will be vertically, so items will be moved on vertical line.
    - Align Items only works if heigh is fixed or defined.
    - flex-start
    - center: this align whole items to the center of container
    - flex-end
    - stretch
    - baseline : this align text items to the center.

<img
  alt="flexbox"
  src={require("./assets/flex-align-items.png").default}
  style={{ margin: "auto", display: "block" }}
/>

<br />

#### 7. **`align-contents`** :

    - With align-items, the items align relative to their own row, not the whole container.
      So if there is only one row, it looks centered in the container.
      But if there are multiple rows, each row aligns individually, not as one group.
    - With align-content, the entire group of rows is aligned inside the container (centered, spaced, stretched, etc.), not just individual items.
    -  Unlike `align-items`, which aligns **items inside each row**, `align-content` aligns the **rows themselves**.
    - If align the flex-container lines.
    - It only works with Multi line flex container with ref to Cross Axis.
    - Only works with flex-wrap and wrap-reverse.
    - [**See this CodePen example**](https://codepen.io/Yashpal-Singh-Rathod/pen/pvyKWdP)

#### 8. **`gap`** : Gap define space between items

    - The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items

    ``` css
      .container {
        display: flex;
        ...
        gap: 10px; /* both row-gap and column-gap are 10 */
        gap: 10px 20px; /* row-gap column gap */
        row-gap: 10px;
        column-gap: 20px;
      }

    ```

### Flex Items Properties

#### 1. **`align-self`** :

    - Align self make an items to be placed on cross axis,
    - It supports, center, flex start, flex-end, baseline.
    - ** There is no Justify Self** as that is not possible technically,
    - In justify, items are moved across main axis, but they are in one line, so single items can not be moved individually.
    - Think like you are stuck in a traffic, there are cars in front and back side of you, so you can not individually move in that line.
    - While In cross axis, it is like three people climbing mountain suing rope, so any individual can move to top, center or bottom of mountain.

#### 2. **`flex-grow`** :

    - Given flex item will grow **Number** times bigger than other items in container when space available.
    - Default is 0.

#### 3. **`flex-shrink`** :

    - Same as flex-grow but shrink by given number.
    - default is 1.

#### 4. **`flex-basis`** :

    - Defies initial length for flex-items
    - This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
    - Default is **auto**
    - In auto extra space is distributes to new items.
    - flex-basis: 0px, means it take only space for context require and all other space is distributed.
    - In a Flex row, flex-basis does the same thing as width. In a Flex column, flex-basis does the same thing as height.

#### 5. **`flex`** :

    - This is shorthand for **flex-grow,flex-shrink,flex-basis**.
    - flex:0,0,0.5 means, grow is default, shrink is set to 0 and flex basis is 0.5.

#### 6. **`order`** :

    - By default teh flex items are laid out in the source order, but with help of **order** we can change the order.

### Flex values:

- `flex: 0 1 auto`

  - `flex-grow: 0` → Item **will not grow** even if there is free space.
  - `flex-shrink: 1` → Item **can shrink** when there isn’t enough space.
  - `flex-basis: auto` → Width is based on the item’s content.
  - The item is **shrinkable but not expandable**.

---

- `flex: 1 1 auto`

  - `flex-grow: 1` → Item can **grow** if there is extra space.
  - `flex-shrink: 1` → Item can **shrink** if needed.
  - `flex-basis: auto`.
  - Fully flexible: items grow and shrink based on available space and distribute leftover space **equally**.

---

- `flex: 0 0 auto`

  - `flex-grow: 0`
  - `flex-shrink: 0`
  - `flex-basis: auto`
  - The item remains **exactly its content size** — fully inflexible.

---

- `flex-basis: 0` vs `flex-basis: auto`

  - `flex-basis: 0`
  - Items start as width **0**
  - All available space is distributed according to `flex-grow` values

- `flex-basis: auto`

  - Items first take **their natural content width**
  - Only **remaining free space** is distributed based on `flex-grow`
  - Better when items have different content sizes.
