<FontStyle text="1. Display:" heading="h2" color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)" />

- Display is most foundational property in css.
- Default value of display is **Flow Layout**.
- Display defines how elements will be rendered in page.
- Flow layout, sometimes called normal flow, is the default way browsers lay out HTML elements when no special positioning (e.g., position: absolute, float) or layout modes (e.g., Flexbox, Grid) are applied. In Flow layout:
- Elements are positioned sequentially in the order they appear in the HTML document.
- The layout respects the box model (margin, padding, border, content) of each element.
- Elements are arranged based on their display property, which determines whether they behave as:

  - Block-level elements: Take up the full width of their parent container and stack vertically (e.g., div, p, h1 with display: block).
  - Inline elements: Sit side by side, flowing within a line, and only take up the width of their content (e.g., span, a with display: inline).
  - Inline-block elements: Flow inline but respect width and height like block elements (e.g., display: inline-block).

- Other value of display are **( none, flex, grid, block, inline)**.
  - **None** : HTML element is not visible in page, it doesn't take any space in layout.

<FontStyle text="2. Position:" heading="h2" color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)" />

- Element position is decided by 'position' property in css.
- Position property defines how element will behaves or positioned on web page, like what happen when page is scrolled.
- When a web renders html, it prints the element in right to bottom way, means it start printing from left goes to right adn then start again from nest line.
- Means every element is positioned on webpage and has offset values ( or coordinates x and y ).
- We can change the position of the element using top, left, right, bottom values.
- Default value of position is **static**.
- Position support these values ( static, relative, fixed, absolute, sticky).

  <FontStyle text="1. Static" heading="h4" color="orange" />

        - In static position element is static means once it is printed by web initially, **we can not change the position using top, bottom, right, left**
        - It behaves with normal ( Flow layout) flow of the page.

  <FontStyle text="2. Relative" heading="h4" color="orange" />

        - In relative position we can move the element by top, bottom, left and right properties.

  <FontStyle text="3. Fixed" heading="h4" color="orange" />

        - It behaved similar like relative, \*\* but the element won't move when page is scrolled, it will remain at same clientX and clientY values.
        - clientX and clientY are coordinates from the window top/left edge.

  <FontStyle text="3. Absolute" heading="h4" color="orange" />

        - When element is positioned absolute, ** It is free from current flow of web**, means it is no more following standard flow and positioned in web.
        - It will be positioned respective to it's parent element, If no parent element is there, it window will be it's parent.
        - It is used to create modal in web, like when user click on button a modal appear, that modal used absolute position to remain near by of the button.

  <FontStyle text="3. Sticky" heading="h4" color="orange" />

        - Sticky is combination of 'relative' and 'fixed', an element positioned as a sticky will behaves like relative, once the condition meet, it works as a sticky.
        - In below element when potion is not 0, it will behave like relative ( normal ), once user scroll down and element 'top = 0', it start behaving sticky.
        - It is used for headers.

```css
.header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  border: 1px solid rend;
}
```

<FontStyle text="3. Offset Related:" heading="h2" color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)" />

- top, left, right, top,
- All this property are used to set position of element.
- This all only work when position is not set to static.

<FontStyle text="4. Z-index:" heading="h2" color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)" />

- Z-index is used to define priority of element in stack.
- If there are multiple element stacked, than element with higher z-index will be on the top of stack.
- Consider we have a sidebar and there is button in sidebar which open quantity modal, if modal z-index is higher then it will be visible on the top of the sidebar.

<FontStyle
  text="5. Element Dimension:"
  heading="h2"
  color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)"
/>

- In css to set element dimension, we've many properties, few of them are as below.
- width: To set width of element.
- height: To set height of element.
- min-width, max-width, mi-height, max-height.
- padding: padding sets space around by element, between border and element.
- margin: margin set space around the element, after the border.

<FontStyle text="6. Box-Sizing:" heading="h2" color="hsl(255deg 85% 30%)" />

- The `box-sizing` property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated. The default value is **content-box**.
- **Content-box** means the height and width only include the actual content size — **not** the border or padding.
- This can cause layout issues when borders and padding are applied because the total size may exceed what you intended.
- When `box-sizing` is set to **border-box**, the height and width **include** the padding and border.
- For example, if an element has `width: 150px`, `height: 50px`, `border: 2px`, and `padding: 30px`, the overall size will remain within 50px in height — the content area will shrink to accommodate the padding and border.

```jsx live
function renderBoxSizingView() {
  // Main container style
  const mainCard = {
    width: "100%",
    padding: "16px",
    borderRadius: "20px",
    background: "linear-gradient(135deg, #f8f9fa, #ffffff)",
    boxShadow: "0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)",
    position: "relative",
  };

  // Card items wrapper style
  const cardItems = {
    padding: "10px",
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "column",
    alignContent: "center",
  };

  // List items style
  const listItems = {
    display: "flex",
    flexWrap: "wrap",
    justifyContent: "space-evenly",
    gap: "40px",
    alignItems: "center",
    listStyle: "none", // Important to remove default bullets
    padding: 0, // Remove default padding
  };

  // Render a card item
  const RenderCardItem = (boxSizingType) => (
    <div>
      <div
        style={{
          border: "2px solid blue",
          borderRadius: "10px",
          height: "50px",
          width: "150px",
          padding: "30px",
          textTransform: "capitalize",
          boxSizing: boxSizingType,
          display: "flex",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
        }}
      >
        {boxSizingType}
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <div style={mainCard}>
      <div style={cardItems}>
        <ul style={listItems}>
          <li>{RenderCardItem("content-box")}</li>
          <li>{RenderCardItem("border-box")}</li>
        </ul>
        <div
          style={{
            width: "100%",
            textAlign: "center",
            color: "#e74c3c",
          }}
        >
          {" "}
          Both boxes have the same height, width, and padding. The only difference
          is that the first box uses content-box for the box-sizing property, while
          the second uses border-box.
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
