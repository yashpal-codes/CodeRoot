# Iterations and Conditions in PHP

## Conditions in PHP:

- **If-else statement:**

```php
$age = 20;
if($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are eligible to vote";
} else {
    echo "You are not eligible to vote";
}
```

- **Switch statement:**

```php
$day = "Monday";

switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
        echo "Today is Monday";
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        echo "Today is Tuesday";
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        echo "Today is Wednesday";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Today is not a weekday";
}
```

## Iterations in PHP:

- We can use for loop, while loop, do while, and foreach loop in PHP.

#### do while loop:

```php
$counter = 0;

do {
    echo "Counter: $counter <br>";
    $counter++;
} while ($counter <= 5);

```

#### for loop:

- It is similar to the for loop in other programming languages.

- for loop:
  - First it will check the condition.
  - Now execute the code block.
  - Increment/Decrement the counter.
  - Repeat the above steps until the condition is false.

````php

$sum = 0;

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    $sum += $i;
}

* We can use **break** and **continue** statements in loops.

```php

$sum = 0;

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        continue;
        // Continue statement stop current iteration and start next iteration.
    }

    if ($i == 8) {
        break;
        // Break statement stop the loop.
    }

    $sum += $i;
}

// Output: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 23
````

#### while loop:

```php
$counter = 0;

while ($counter <= 5) {
    echo "Counter: $counter <br>";
    $counter++;
}
```

#### foreach loop:

- It is used to iterate over arrays.

```php
$nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

foreach($nums as $item){
    echo $item;
}

// Output: 12345
```
