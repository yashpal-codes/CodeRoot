# Forms in PHP

- We can use HTML form with PHP to collect user input.

<TextHighlighter text='In PHP, **superglobals **`$_GET`, **`$_POST` and **$_Server are used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form with method "get" or "post" respectively.' />

- $\_GET and $\_POST are associate arrays that store form data using key and value pairs

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <form action='form.php' method='post'>
        Name: <input type='text' name='name'><br>
        Email: <input type='email' name='email'><br>
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

- form element has two important attributes

  - action : Specify the URL, that process the form data. In our case it is `form.php`.
  - method : Specify the HTTP method to handle form data.

- The form method is case-insensitive. It means that you can use either post or POST. If you don’t specify the method attribute, the form element will use the get method by default.

### $\_GET:

- If we submit form using `GET` method, then we can access form data using `$_GET` superglobal.

```php
// This will be a html form
<form action = 'form.php' method='get'>
    <div>
        <label for='email'>Email:</label>
        <input type='text' name='email' />
    </div>
    <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
</form>

//In form.php

if (isset(#_GET['email'])) {
    echo $_GET['email'];
    // process the form data
}

```

- Unlike the POST method, the GET method appends the form data in the URL that processes the form. Suppose the URL that processes the form is http://localhost/form.php. When you enter the email as hello@phptutorial.net and submit a form, you’ll see that the email value is appended to the URL like this

```html
http://localhost/form.php?email=hello%40phptutorial.net
```

- If the form has multiple input elements, the web browser will append the form inputs to the URL in the following format:

```html
http://localhost/form.php?name=John&email=hello%40phptutorial.net
```

---

### $\_POST:

- If we submit form using `POST` method, then we can access form data using `$_POST` superglobal.

- For example, if a form has an input element with the name email, you can access the email value in PHP via the $\_POST['email']. If the form doesn’t have an email input, the $\_POST won’t have any element with the key 'email'.

```php
// This will be a html form
<form action = 'form.php' method='post'>
    <div>
        <label for='email'>Email:</label>
        <input type='text' name='email' />
    </div>
    <button type='submit'>Submit</button>

//In form.php
if (isSet(_POST['email'])){
    echo $_POST['email'];
    // process the form data
}
```

---

### $\_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']

- We can use `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` to check the request method of the form.

```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    // process the form data
}
```

- This is useful when you have a form that can handle both GET and POST requests.

## Form Validation in PHP:

- We normally do form validation in client side using HTML and javascript. But it is also important to validate form data in server side using PHP.

<TextHighlighter text="We can use **htmlspecialchars() to escape the form data. This function convert special characters to HTML entities. This functio is used to prevent **XSS cross site scripting " />

- When you use htmlspecialchars(), the function replaces certain characters with their HTML entity equivalents. These characters are:

  - & (ampersand) becomes &amp;
  - " (double quote) becomes &quot;
  - ' (single quote) becomes &#039; (Note: this conversion is optional and depends on the ENT_QUOTES or ENT_NOQUOTES flag)
  - < (less than) becomes &lt;
  - ' > ' (greater than) becomes &gt;

- **htmlspecialchars()** helps mitigate XSS by converting special characters in user inputs to their HTML entity equivalents, ensuring that the input is treated as **_plain text _**rather than **executable code**.

<TextHighlighter text="**filter_var() is used to sanitize and validate form data." />

- It is used to filter variables with a specified filter. This function is useful for validating form data, such as email addresses, URLs, and integers.

#### **Validation Filters**:

1. **FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL** - Validates an email address
2. **FILTER_VALIDATE_URL** - Validates a URL
3. **FILTER_VALIDATE_INT** - Validates an integer
4. **FILTER_VALIDATE_FLOAT** - Validates a float
5. **FILTER_VALIDATE_IP** - Validates an IP address
6. **FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN** - Validates a boolean

#### **Sanitization Filters**:

1. **FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL** - removes invalid chart from email
2. **FILTER_SANITIZE_URL** - removes all illegal characters from URL
3. **FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT** - removes all illegal characters from number except digit, plus and minus sign.

```php
$email = "
if (filter_var($email,FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)){
    echo "Valid email address";
} else {
    echo "Invalid email address";
}

//Sanitize and validate email

// User input with potentially malicious or invalid characters
$input_email = " <script>alert('hack');</script>user@example.com; DROP TABLE users;";

// Sanitize the input email
$sanitized_email = filter_var($input_email, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);

// Output the sanitized result

echo "Original Input: " . $input_email . "\n";

echo "Sanitized Email: " . $sanitized_email;

//Original Input: <script>alert('hack');</script>user@example.com; DROP TABLE users;

//Sanitized Email: scriptalert'hack'scriptuser@example.comDROPTABLEusers
```
