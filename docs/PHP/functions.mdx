# Function in PHP

A function can return a value. Only one value can be returned from a function, not more than one. You do that using the **return** keyword. If omitted, the function returns **null**.

- A variable declared inside a function is local to that function.

```php
function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}

echo add(1, 2); // 3
```

- IN javascript all fucntions are by default closures, so they can access outer variable, but in PHP functions are not closures by default, so they can't access outer variable.

- In PHP variable declared inside a fucntion is local to that function and only available inside that function.

- However, we can access global variables using **global** keyword, and other variables using **use** keyword.

**\* In PHP function parameters are also local to that function.**

```php
$globalVar = 10;

function add($a, $b) {
    global $globalVar;
    $c = 5;
    return $a + $b + $globalVar + $c;
}

echo add(1, 2); // 18
```

- **In javascript, values are passed br reference to the function, so any change in value inside the function will also change the actual value.
  However, In PHP values are passed as a value only, reference is not passed, so any change made inside function will not change actual value**

<TextHighlighter text="But if we want to pass value by reference, we need to use **& operator before the parameter name" />

````php

```JS
const x = ['john','dev','swift']
const y = [32,34,45.89]

function nameChange(name, newName) {
    name[0] = "yash"
    return name.concat(newName)
}

console.log(nameChange(x,y))
// ['yash','dev','swift',32,34,45.89]
console.log(x)
// ['yash','dev','swift']
// Here x is changed

#### There are three types of functions in PHP:

1. Named Functions.
2. Anonymous Functions.
3. Arrow Functions.

We have already seen Named Functions. Let's see Anonymous Functions.

#### Anonymous Functions:

- As name suggest, these functions don't have a name. They are defined using the **function** keyword followed by the parameters and the function body.

- They are stored into a variable.

- In anonymous functions, we can use **use** keyword to access the outer variables.

```php
$string = "Addinf numbers";
$sum = function($a, $b) use($string) {
    echo $string;
    // here $string is accessible because of use keyword
    return $a + $b;
};

$sum(1, 2); // 3
```

#### Arrow Functions:

- we use **fn** keyword to define arrow functions.

- Arrow functions are always anonymous, and we can access outer variable without using use keyword.

- Arrow functions support the same features as anonymous functions, except that using variables from the parent scope is always automatic.

```php
$b = 10;

$test = fn($a) => $a+$b;
// here we have access to $b without using use keyword
echo $test(5);
// 15
```
