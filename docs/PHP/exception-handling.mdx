# Error Handling in PHP

**In PHP, we can use try, catch, and finally blocks to handle exceptions.**

- **Try Block:** The code that can potentially throw an exception is placed inside the try block.
- **Catch Block:** The code that handles the exception is placed inside the catch block.
- **Finally Block:** The code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception was thrown, is placed inside the finally block.

- In below code **$err** is a instance/object of a Exception class.

<TextHighlighter text="We can use keyword **Throwable to catch both 'Exception' and 'Error' objects." />{" "}

```php
$item = 4;

try{
    if($item > 3){
        throw new Exception("Item is greater than 3 \n");
    }
    echo "Item is less than 3";
} catch(Exception $err){
    echo "Caught exception: ", $err->getMessage();
} finally {
    echo "Finally block";
}


// Output: Caught exception: Item is greater than 3
//Finally block
```

```php
// Use of Throwable

$number = 3;
$array = [];

try{
    for($i = $number; $i > -1; $i--){
        $num = $number/$i;
        array_push($array,$num);
    }
}catch(Throwable $e){
    echo "Caught exception: ", $e->getMessage();
}finally{
	print_r($array);
}

// Output: Caught exception: Division by zero
// Array ( [0] => 3 [1] => 1.5 [2] => 1 [3] => 0 )
```
